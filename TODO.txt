client:     feature: generate SVG from SCD(start on top from IFL, and process elements, working downward based on connections, use templates for mimics, measurement, animation. resolve address+lnref


--future projects--
proxy:      implement 104-slave <-> IEC61850-client proxy (csv with IOA - LNode, type:int/float/bool/enum/string/bool-control/enum-control/...)
scada:      implement SCADA system (scrollable-map[logic, GIS,], event/alarm-view, historian, RTDB, object/asset/drawing DB, 104-master)


KNOWN BUGS:
BUG: most LN's assume a type of extref in the callback. include more error checking on this, as its not enforced by the SCL or by the loading mechanism
BUG: deallocation is not done nicely
BUG: scl items cannot contain spaces, not even desc. elements!
